### Hi there 👋

🔭 I’m Gokul, a Computer Science Engineering student at National Institue of Technology Calicut (Bachelor of Technology).

🌟 I enjoy a lot of things - Web Dev, Ai/ML, Problem Solving/Competetive Coding; and to ease up I play games, watch youtbue, listen to music, hang out with my dog (and two cats), read books, travel... Sometimes I do get my hands dirty by learning/doing/trying new interseting things like video editing or making music or cooking or making bonsai 😄 

🌱 I’m currently focussing on Cryptography, putting my heart and soul to understand the security systems which keeps us all safe. I'm also working on a very interesting project (my final year project here at NITC) that basically involves making a Database management system from groundup, which is gonna be used for a real good purpose 🌞 


⚡ Last Summer I spent as an Intern at Goldman Sachs, which was realy fun.
