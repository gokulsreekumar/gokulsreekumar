### Hi there 👋

🔭 I’m Gokul, a Computer Science Engineering student at National Institue of Technology Calicut (Bachelor of Technology).

🌟 I'm interested in a lot of things - Web Dev, Ai/ML, Problem Solving/Competetive Coding; I do enjoy spending time - playing games, watching youtbue, listening to music, hanging out with my dog, reading some books and learning/doing/trying something new, like maybe video editing or making music or cooking 😄 

🌱 I’m currently focussing and learnging Cryptography, putting my heart and soul to understand the security systems keeping me safe. Also I'm working on a very interesting project (my final year project here at NITC) which is basically making a Database management system from groundup, which is gonna be used for a real good purpose 🌞 


⚡ Last Summer I spent as an Intern at Goldman Sachs, which was realy fun.
